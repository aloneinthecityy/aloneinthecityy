- ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m @aloneinthecityy (better known as Maria Eduarda) and i'm a programmer in training. I know this profile is nothing professional 
(after all, who puts anime photo as a profile?), i use this account to learn and post little programs.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in PHP, CSS, C++, JavaScript, Python, Android, Linux and etc.
